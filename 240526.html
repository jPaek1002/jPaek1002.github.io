<td align="left"><p>I'm glad I finish this week on a good note. First of all, I ran a half-marathon, an entire 13.1 miles! 
The course was brutal. I held a comfortable 8:30 pace until there was a 400 ft elevation gain up Torrey Pines reserve.
I look back at it, and I can finally say that it was quite the experience. I would definitely do it again if there wasn't so much incline.
I had these massive blisters on my feet that finally popped, so I can walk normally. Don't worry, all of the skin grew back already.</p>
<p>And I did that race right into midterm week. I actually finished MATH 140C and ECE 171A midterms, which is very good.
Only issue is that I skipped two ECE 171A lectures, so I'm a little behind. In fact, I'm actually pretty behind on a lot of things. 
I need to catch up on probably all of my classes and study for the MATH 144 midterm, which I NEED to do well on.
I realized that Fourier analysis is not something I can just use intuition to solve. Probably going to spend a good 5-6 hours on studying.
Otherwise, there was an ECE 276B project due, and I actually got it done. 
I will be posting the report soon, but there's some extra stuff I want to put in. </p>
<p>I don't know what to say. I don't feel burnt out (or at least I tell myself that I'm not), but I don't feel great either. 
I definitely feel very satisfied, in fact, very proud of what I'm achieving so far, but something always feels missing.
It's not like I didn't go out of anything. I made a ton of new friends and met a ton of new people this school year,
and yet I don't feel very fulfilled in one way or another.</p>
<p>So apparently my petitions for ECE 15 and ECE 100 did NOT go through, and they told be two weeks ago in the VAC message.
I guess it is my fault, but I don't know why they didn't reject or close the petition on the petition portal.
I was thinking that it was still under consideration, but I guess there is no one to blame but me. I guess I should actually read emails. 
Otherwise, I submitted another petition to replace ECE 15 with MAE 288A and ECE 100 with MATH 294. I will likely hear back this Tuesday.</p>

<p>One thing that I noticed is that I've been very judgemental lately, so I think I need to reflect on that a little more. 
I think I haven't been destressing with recreational activities, but what is recreational at this point. 
I think that it is very hard to pinpoint what is something that I truly enjoy whether it be socializing with people or learning new things.
Maybe this is indeed burn-out from doing anything, and I just need a day of doing absolutely nothing. 
Only problem is that this goes against my values of being productive, so this is a dilemma.
Whatever my issue is, I'll try to diagnose it after finals. There is no time to wait. I must move forward. </p>
<p>On the bright side, I think I have successfully detached from playing League on a normal basis. 
I don't feel the need to play spontaneously anymore. I don't feel stressed for not playing or anything.
I think that my approach to games is just a medium for social interaction and fun rather than a coping mechanism for my stress.
I guess this is good to extent since I lost an outlet for destressing. However, this is not my concern just yet.</p>
<p>For anyone who is wondering what I'm doing over the summer, here's a nice list:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>COSMOS teaching/lab assistant (July)</p>
</li>
<li><p>ECE 5 course staff (August)</p>
</li>
<li><p>ECE 101 course staff maybe (August)</p>
</li>
<li><p>ECE 45 course staff (July - August)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finish paper with Poveda</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maybe do more research with Prof. Atanasov or Zheng</p>
</li>
<li><p>TritonAI Boat+Drone localization design project</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look into postgraduate and PhD programs + apply to jobs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Learn how to draw (1 hour a day!!!)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have some ambitious goals that I want to fulfill over the summer. I think I got this.
Anyways, here's a good quote that I thought of these past few weeks.</p>
