Week 6 of Spring 2024, Friday.</p>
<p>Welcome back to my blog! 
I'm actually a little worried right now since I'm getting a little complacent in my ability to survive this quarter.
Basically, I used to start homework always a week early, but now I start 5 hours before the deadline, which isn't recommended for math homework. 
Already faced some consequences with the MAE288A homework. I still finished though!
I've been playing a little too much League, and my productive time at school has declined. 
I think that next week, I have to get myself back into shape. </p>
<p>BIG UPDATES THIS WEEK:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I might be enrolling in my eighth class after my course request goes through for DSC 291. Nothing happened yet, but registrar will add it soon.</p>
</li>
<li><p></p>
</li>
<li><p>My petitions to not take ECE25, PHYS2C, CHEM6A went through!!! BIG W. Hopefully the same follows with ECE15 and ECE17. They really letting me get away with this.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<td align="left"></td></tr></table>
<p>I'm thinking that this wasn't a good idea, but then what else would I be doing if I didn't have work?
That was a rhetorical question, and the answer is League of Legends. </p>
