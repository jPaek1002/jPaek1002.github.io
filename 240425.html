Week 4 of Spring 2024, Thursday.
Hello, and welcome to my blog! This is just a place where I can write out and organize my thoughts and schedules. 
I initially intended to post this yesterday, but I had to change the website's project structures. 
My markup language wouldn't compile, so I had to do some fixing. 
This is my first post, and I hope I don't sound too cringe. </div>

<p>Midterm week. Technically, it's basically done since I took my MATH140C midterm, which was probably the most stressful.
This is what I have in the next week:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MATH 102, ECE 171A midterm</p>
</li>
<li><p>MATH 144 midterm next Tuesday (April 30th)</p>
</li>
<li><p>ECE 276B Project 1 due next Tuesday (April 30th)</p>
</li>
<li><p>MATH 294 HW 2 due next Wednesday (May 1st)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meet with Qihao about DRP</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meet with Professor Poveda</p>
</li>
<li><p>TritonAI boat localization algorithm</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to completed my paper before the April 29th deadline for the SIAM: Mathematics in Data Science conference, but midterms took ahold of me.
Actually, I was supposed to see my PI 4 PM last Thursday (April 18th), but I sat in the lab for an hour instead of finding him at his office.
I received an email at 5 PM sharp during class, which kinda felt super bad about.
It's okay though! I'm in no rush (although I didn't make much progress in the past few weeks). My goal is to finish by the end of June.
There are a ton of things to do, and I am just leisurely writing this blog post. How funny.</p>
